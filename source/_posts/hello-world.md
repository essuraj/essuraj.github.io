title: The habit of writing up thoughts
---

This is my "Hello World ! 👐🌏". Learning a language is of no use unless it gives you a better perspective of life. And by language I mean both human and programmatically.

With that crap out of the way, I will make it a habit to write down all my experiences into this blog for the rest of my career.

I do this for the following reasons.
- As a developer, rapid technological changes is an occupational hazard. 
- It might help someone to improve their career (I hope).
- Encourage people to do the same and be a part of the modern literature of programming
- Open people up for a brighter and greater future.
